## Welcome to chairbnb. 
chairbnb is a website designed for users to rent out chairs in their areas. Chairs are a necessary part of life and sometimes yours just doesn't do it for you. Test out chairs that you may love later on without the commitment of purchasing them for life. As of now, our website boasts the ability for users to add/delete/edit their own chair listings, browse through all the current listings, and functionality with reviews which allows users to read reviews and  create/delete their own! This project utilizes Node, Express, Sequelize, React, and Redux. We all love chairs, but now, we invite you to take a seat and  broaden your horizons in this wonderful world.
